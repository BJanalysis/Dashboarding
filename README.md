2. **Total Innings Batted**
   - *Description:* Total number of innings a batsman got a chance to bat.
   - *Formula:* `Total Innings Batted = COUNT(fact_batting_summary[match_id])`
   
3. **Total Innings Dismissed**
   - *Description:* Number of innings batsman got out.
   - *Formula:* `Total Innings Dismissed = SUM(fact_batting_summary[out])`

8. **Boundary %**
   - *Description:* Percentage of boundaries scored by the Batsman.
   - *Formula:* `Boundary % =  DIVIDE(SUM(fact_batting_summary[Boundary runs]),[Total Runs],0)`
   
9. **Average Balls Faced**
   - *Description:* Average balls faced by the batter in an innings.

    - *Description:* No. of runs allowed per wicket.
    - *Formula:* `Bowling Average = DIVIDE([Runs Conceded],[Wickets],0)`
    
16. **Total Innings Bowled**
    - *Description:* Total number of innings bowled by a bowler.
    - *Formula:* `Total Innings Bowled = DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_bowling_summary[match_id])`
    
17. **Dot Ball %**
    - *Description:* Percentage of dot balls bowled by a bowler.
    - *Formula:* `Dot Ball % = DIVIDE(SUM(fact_bowling_summary[zeros]), SUM(fact_bowling_summary[balls]),0)`
